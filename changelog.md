changelog_2020-09-14
- It makes no difference when you start a show now. After going live, the longest you’ll ever have to wait for your show to start playing on the website is 30 seconds.
- Added support for Premiere videos. You can schedule shows by uploading videos now. This will also help with lag problems, maybe new shy DJs, field recordings, and editted videos.
- 10$ less a month (so now it just cost 5$ a month to run the server.)
- Archives are built using a special unlisted playlist. If you don’t want a show on the archive, you can remove it from the list yourself. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLo8pUGGGB_pcVtFOKlSVc70sNFlP565Gr
- Only two minutes of elevator music before any show.
